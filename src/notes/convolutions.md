Convolutions are applied in many different fields with very versatile use cases.

When combining two sets of values into one, we can perform different mathematical operations to make this combination work.
For instance we can *multiply* and *add* values together - *dividing* and *substracting* are just negative cases of these two.

We can do the same thing for functions.

Let's say we have two sets of values

## Discrete convolutions
To get started we need to review some things from probability theory.
