Yesterday was 04-20, a day that is celebrated by many people around the world. I am one of them.

Now, one of the main stereotypes about people, specificly stoners, is that they are lazy.
Well, I am a stoner and I am quite lazy. But I wouldn't say that I am not productive.
So instead, I look for solutions that make me more productive.


One thing that I love is exploring new technologies by reading articles. But I am very lazy and impatient. 
Most of the time those articles are quite long. 
And mostly they are unnecessarily long.
So I decided to write a bot that summarizes articles for me and generates audio files out of these summaries.

Because I am a lazy boy, I will provide you the probably easiest solution to all of that.

We'll use Python, the `huggingface_hub` library, and [`factory`](https://github.com/philipp-zettl/factory).

Let's assume you have the URL of the article you want to summarize. For example, this article [here]({{ 'the-wet-dream-of-a-lora-explorer' | notesUrl }}).

```python
foo
```
