## Hello fellow reader,
my name is Philipp, I am a undergraduate student in a Berlin based university. Since my early teenage years 
I was interested in tech and programming, but spent most of my time playing several MMORPGs like Diablo 2 
and World of Warcraft.
A few years ago I moved out of my parents place and started studying mathematics in one of the most distant places 
in Germany. During the first years I always told myself to not get to comfortable living here since 
>it's only for a few years and I'm gonna go back home anyways.

So I **started** working on several private projects
- a smart home platform to connect all your devices with a local raspberry pi so you can control all your devices through a web interface
- a social web app (tinder like) where you can swipe for a lunch partner to socialize and explore different restaurants
- a time management tool to track working times, with scheduling and team management
- a ml image detection service to detect the species a specific kind of plant
    - including a website to categorize images
    - a coin system to exchange image classifications with manual classified images

out of those ideas none ever made it into production.

## The problem
I love starting but it's way too hard to finish.

_But why is that so?_

For me the main reason is perfectionism. Every time I end up with my first frontend for an app I'm dissatisfied with 
the result.

I'm more of a backend person but saw too many awesome designs and
functionality, or just a great UX which feels like it will take several hours just to get the basic functionality done. 
So mostly I just stop at a certain point and forget about the project until someone tells me a new live struggling problem
and I'm back at the beginning of a new project.


## The solution?
One day a former colleague approached me after he found out I my contract was soon to be expired and I was looking for a 
new job and told me his idea to participate in the shared economy by renting action cams.

I like the idea of shared economy and don't like wasting resources, so he had me at
>Would you like to help me with my website?

My immediate thought was how awesome the idea is, that it needs to be super easy to implement and of course

## From here
Thanks for reading so far, partner!
During the next weeks I will tell the story of my journey of [Learning React the hard way](/old-blog/learning-react-the-hard-way-part-1), 
[Who needs planning if you have an idea]() and [How I stopped quitting]().
