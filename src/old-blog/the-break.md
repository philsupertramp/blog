### A big disappointment

Hey friend,

A few months passed by already and I got to admit that writing the final post of my series about React will probably take some
time. Hence I will present you a short FAQ – even though no one seriously asked me these questions.

> You told us there will be a new post every week and it's been already 3 months since the last one. 

Sorry, I know that and it's been a hard time for me, too.  
I needed to 
- [x] find a new flat
- [x] end the professional relationship with the person I mentioned within (at least) my [first Post of the series](/old-blog/learning-react-the-hard-way-part-1)
- [x] study for several exams
- [x] move into the new flat
- [ ] and over and all earn serious fucking money to afford furniture

>Are you tired of us as a community? 

###### Obviously I am not tired of the community, what kind of bad joke is that, tho

> Did we disappoint you in some way?
###### And of course you did not disappoint me, lol

> [AITA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/)?
###### No, IATA

> So what is going to happen now?

Since I ended the professional relationship with the guy I was spending 90% of my spear time with, I decided to make a huge step back
regarding tech. I did spent too much time sitting inside, coding and thinking about coding problems.  
Social contacts where only regarding work, which I seriously needed to change. 
The plan is to write a post per month, which seems to be fine for now.

> But why did you do a "short" FAQ instead of finishing your series, which would be way nicer?

Well that isn't that easy for me, I need some distance from the project which I cannot achieve by continuing the series.
It seriously ate me. 

> Ok, I got the problem, what's gonna happen now?

I am continuously working on several ideas, which are not yet ready to be presented to the public.
Needless to say I am still fully in love with tech and especially programming, but for now I can't work for a visionary anymore without having a plan 
and especially another person which helps me inventing stuff.  
I am still working for a corporate and I am more than happy with that.


Also a special thanks to one of my readers which helped me improving this blog a bit by giving helpful and constructive feedback ♥
