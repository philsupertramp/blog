# Ricing
> The term ‘rice’ is used to describe a person’s unix desktop, where ‘ricing’ is when someone is 
custom their desktop such as the icons, panels, or system interface.
When it comes to ricing a tiling window manager though, the ricing of a user’s system becomes much more involved.
Basic things such as the panel bar and application launcher must be configured by the user to gain visual .
