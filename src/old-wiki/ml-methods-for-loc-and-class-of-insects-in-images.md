# Intro
During summer of 2021 I started having conversations with professors regarding my final thesis of my Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics. In that process I was
introduced to the task of classifying insects based on images. I had the initial thought to write my thesis about a Machine Learning related topic and was more interested
in Deep Reinforcement Learning at that time, but didn't put down the offer. After some time exploring RL I got frustrated by the advancement level and was more interested in simpler
methods prior to starting a deep RL project. Hence in early November 2021 I aggreed to the topic _"Machine Learning Methods for Localization and Classification of Insects in Images"_.

> Alright, but how are we supposed to know wat you're talking about, if we have no idea what all these fancy big words mean?

Right.

## Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a field of Mathematics and Computer Science where an algorithm get's a feed of input data
to predict an desired output. This can be split into two groups of tasks, **classification** and **regression**
whereas the former predicts fixed predefined classes based on an input and the latter a number of floating point numbers.
I will give an example for each of those tasks once we covered a few more things.
Frankly speaking ML is around for quite some time and things like logistic regression can solve most common tasks pretty well.

#### Logistical Regression
Logistical Regression is one form of regression. Regression works in general in such way that an input data
gets fit onto an predefined function, more speaking a predefined set of "trainable" variables, called weights \\(\\omega\\)

## Honerable Mentions

### Frequent Google Queries
A thesis doesn't write itself, nor can a developer work without it's helper Google.
This section is dedicated to my beloved search terms which I accumulated while writing my thesis.
One might think that repeating a question over and over again will teach the answer to the person asking, 

| Search queries | Times performed  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| "Convert numpy array to PIL Image"  | 7  |
| "Convert PIL Image to numpy array" | 4 |
